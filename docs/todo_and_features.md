# List of TODO and comming features

List of things to improve and comming features:

- [-] Prometheus metrics?
- [-] Monitor networking in cgroups (for containers, like podman, docker...)
- [-] Add filters: user can filter by protocol, dest ip ...etc
- [-] Multiple interface attachment. Early in development, in order to get a simple first version, I implemented nflux so that it could attach programs to multiple system interfaces. For simplicity in the code and log management, I decided to remove it.
- [-] TESTING!
- [-] Ipv6 traffic
- [-] Autodetect openssl/nss libraries in `nflux tlstrace`
- [-] Running nflux in a container
