# List of TODO and comming features

List of things to improve and comming features:

- [X] Prometheus metrics?
- [X] Monitor networking in cgroups (for containers, like podman, docker...)
- [X] Add filters: user can filter by protocol, dest ip ...etc
- [X] Multiple interface attachment. Early in development, in order to get a simple first version, I implemented nflux so that it could attach programs to multiple system interfaces. For simplicity in the code and log management, I decided to remove it.
- [X] TESTING!
- [X] Ipv6 traffic
- [X] Autodetect openssl/nss libraries in `nflux tlstrace`
