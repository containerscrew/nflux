> [!NOTE]
> [In this branch](https://github.com/containerscrew/nflux/tree/old-20250206) I tried to implement firewall functions using XDP, which I have now removed due to complexity given my initial knowledge of eBPF and control of TCP states (syn/ack/rst...etc) in ipv4, ipv6, among other problems. I will change the tool to be a simple cli to monitor eggress/ingress traffic using TC. As a first feature to learn how to use eBPF with Aya-rs, it is enough for someone who is learning.

# Running `nflux`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/containerscrew/nflux
cargo run --release --config 'target."cfg(all())".runner="sudo -E"' -- -l info -i interface
```

# Features

Pending to add...

# Nflux architecture

Look at what level it works XDP:

![xdp](./xdp.png)

Powerful, right? Same for traffic control (TC).

![tc](./tc.png)

> [!NOTE]
> nflux uses XDP for incoming packet processing (only works with physical interfaces).

# Local development

For local development, I don't use containers since the build process is slow. Visit this custom page for [`local development`](./docs/local_dev.md).

# Contribution

Any improvement is welcome! If you want to help me improve in Rust and eBPF, I'd be delighted!
