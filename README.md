# Intro

Look at what level it works XDP:

![xdp](./xdp.png)

Powerful, right? Same for traffic control (TC).

![tc](./tc.png)

# Features

## Basic XDP firewall

* Block TCP SYN incoming packets
* Allow incoming SYN-ACK incoming packets (for example, you are using your browser)
* Block ICMP incoming packets
* User can allow traffic for specific incoming ports

## Outgoing traffic monitoring

in progress

# Using `nflux`

First of all, clone the repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/containerscrew/nflux.git
```

Since this project is under development just for fun and learning, you need to compile the project in your local:

1. Install rust:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Install nightly toolchain:
```
rustup install stable && rustup toolchain install nightly --component rust-src
```

3. Optional, if using mac or other linux:
```bash
LLVM_SYS_180_PREFIX=$(brew --prefix llvm) cargo install --no-default-features bpf-linker
```

3. **MANDATORY:**
```bash
cargo install bpf-linker
```

## nflux.conf

You can manage the firewall from the file [nflux.conf](./nflux.conf). The most important setting is the network interface.
Set your network interface correctly.

```shell
ip route # check default via
ip link show # then copy the name of the interface and put it in the nflux.conf
nvim nflux.conf # change the interface name
```

> [!CAUTION]
> nflux uses XDP for packet processing. Only works with physical interfaces. If you want to use it with a virtual interface, you need to use the `tc` mode which is not implemented yet.
> For example, you want to monitor incoming traffic using a virtual interface like `tun0` (VPN), you need to use the `tc` mode.

Now, copy the `nflux.conf` to `/etc/nflux/nflux.conf`:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nflux
sudo cp nflux.conf /etc/nflux/nflux.conf
```

Install the binary in your bin path:

```shell
make install-binary
```

Now, copy the custom `systemd service` to `/etc/systemd/system/nflux.service`:

```shell
make install-systemd-service
```

Finally, start your `nflux` service:

```shell
sudo systemctl start nflux.service
sudo systemctl status nflux.service
```

# Testing firewall

Now you can try to map some services using docker. For example, let's expose an nginx server (tcp) and bind9 (udp):

```shell
make compose-up
```

Test the exposed services works. (Recommended) test the services from other device in the same network:

* Nginx server:

```bash
curl http://ip:8081 # Welcome to nginx!
```

* Bind9 server:

```bash
dig @ip -p 5053 mycompany.org A
```

> Change `ip` to the ip of the machine where you are running the docker-compose and where you will run the firewall.

Now, since the exposed port of `nginx` for example is `8081`, let's run the firewall without any allowed port:

For example, in `nflux.conf`:

```toml
[log]
log_level = "info" # trace, debug, info, warn or error. Defaults to info if not set
log_type = "text" # text or json. Defaults to text if not set

[nflux]
interface_name = "wlp2s0"

[firewall]
# All incoming connections will be blocked by default
# You can specify allowed IP addresses and ports
# This will allow both, udp and tcp connections
allowed_ipv4 = [] # Specify IP addresses you want to allow. Will be able to access full ports tcp/udp
allowed_ports = [22, 5353] # Specify ports you want to allow. Everyone will be able to access these ports. No ip filtering
allow_icmp = true
```

Try again `curl http://ip:8081` and you will see that the connection is blocked.

Change the `interface_name` to your physical interface name, also you can play changing the `allowed_ipv4` and `allowed_ports` to allow some traffic.

# Debugging

```shell
```bash
sudo bpftool prog list # show ebpf running programs
ip link show dev wlo1 # xdp attached to your interface
```

Any improvement is welcome! If you want to help me improve in Rust and eBPF, I'd be delighted!
