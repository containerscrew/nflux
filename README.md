# What is nflux?

Nflux is an [`eBPF`](./docs/what_is_ebpf.md)-based tool that monitors `incoming/outgoing` traffic on a Linux system by attaching a `TC (Traffic Control)` program using eBPF technology. It can be attached to both physical and virtual interfaces (wireguard), allowing us to obtain networking data at a very low level.

> Supports only ethernet interfaces
> _Supports only Ipv4 packet sniffing (Ipv6 is being implemented)_.
