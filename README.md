> [!NOTE]
> [In this branch](https://github.com/containerscrew/nflux/tree/old-20250206) I tried to implement firewall functions using XDP, which I have now removed due to complexity given my initial knowledge of eBPF and control of TCP states (syn/ack/rst...etc) in ipv4, ipv6, among other problems. I will change the tool to be a simple cli to monitor eggress/ingress traffic using TC. As a first feature to learn how to use eBPF with Aya-rs, it is enough for someone who is learning.

# Nflux architecture

Look at what level it works XDP:

![xdp](./xdp.png)

Powerful, right? Same for traffic control (TC).

![tc](./tc.png)

> [!NOTE]
> nflux uses XDP for incoming packet processing (only works with physical interfaces).

# Features

Pending to add...

# Running `nflux`

> [!WARNING]
> In Fedora, where selinux is enforced by default, I'm having some problems.
> Quick fix (not secure): `sudo setenforce 0`

```bash
ip link show # get the name of your PHYSICAL interface
# edit nflux.toml and set your physical interface
```

> Monitoring for VPN interfaces like wireguard, not working properly yet

By the moment, run `nflux` locally (see next [local-dev](https://github.com/containerscrew/nflux?tab=readme-ov-file#local-development))

# Local development

For local development, I don't use containers since the build process is slow. Visit this custom page for [`local development`](./docs/local_dev.md).

# Contribution

Any improvement is welcome! If you want to help me improve in Rust and eBPF, I'd be delighted!
